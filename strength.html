        <div class="body">
            <p>We're on a one-way street.</p>
            <p>Technology will pull humanity faster and faster through an infinite knowledge space. The turbulence will make rigid belief systems more and more appealing. And when left unchecked, these belief systems will rot.</p>
            <p>Such rotting can only be fixed by those who are willing to acknowledge the flaws in their understanding of the world, and who have the skill to fix them. The faster the world is moving, the more difficult this will be.</p>
            <p>What does this mean?</p>
            <p>It means the future relies on strength.</p>
            <p>Strength to act morally, no matter how distant the payoff. To posit material ideals, no matter how quickly they're made redundant. To reject cynicism, no matter the temptation. To avoid weakness, no matter the zero-sum clarion calls.</p>
            <p>There's no turning back, as far as I can see.</p>
            <p>Our lives speak for themselves. Better to die in the arena than to live in stasis.</p>
            <p>We must rise to the occasion, even if the occasion is our own extinction.</p>
            <p><i>Especially</i> if it's our own <a href="./all2gether">extinction</a>.</p>
