        <p>The world is made of people.</p>
        <p>For millennia, our ancestors have pushed the frontier of technology audaciously towards the future.</p>
        <p>But despite all these particle accelerators and antibiotics, us humans have remained the centre of attention.</p>
        <p>This is not a coincidence.</p>
        <p>Compared to other species (or computers) on earth, we’re uniquely capable of creating new explanatory theories.*</p>
        <p>Why does this matter?</p>
        <p>Because while the world is made of humans, humans are bounded by human nature.</p>
        <p>It can be uncomfortable to think of ourselves as transactional, predictable, brainstem-driven creatures…</p>
        <p>But to see the world clearly, we need to see <i>people</i> clearly.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the idea of <a href="./value">value.</a></p>

        <i><p>* This is the core assumption that these principles rest on. I'm comfortable making it, because if it breaks, humans will probably go extinct (or be domesticated by robots).</p></i>
