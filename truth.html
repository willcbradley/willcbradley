            <p>Talk is cheap.</p>
            <p>To build fundamentally valuable skills, we need fundamentally reliable mechanisms of error correction.</p>
            <p>And unfortunately, the world is full of misleading signals.</p>
            <p>For instance: imagine I play you a song on the guitar (I don't know how to play the guitar).</p>
            <p>Out of politeness, you might tell me I'm not that bad.</p>
            <p>But if I asked you to buy a recording of my guitar songs for $20, I doubt you'd be so lenient.</p>
            <p>Which brings us to the two forcing functions for truth: free markets (which teach us communication) and nature (which teaches us to think from principles).</p>
            <p>"Markets" can include any kind of voluntary transaction, not just monetary, and "nature" can include anything grounded in physical laws, not just rocket science.</p>
            <p>The less diluted these are, the better.</p>
            <p>(Sometimes, we might separate ourselves from these mechanisms for hedging purposes, but more on that later.)</p>
            <p>Then, once we have a strong enough foundation, we can move on to <a href="./creativity">the fun part</a>.</p>
