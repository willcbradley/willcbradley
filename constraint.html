            <p>Time only moves forward.</p>
            <p>To live, we need to risk making mistakes. And sometimes, mistakes are permanent.</p>
            <p>This creates constraints. Restrictions placed on us by our younger, stupider selves. Complete decisions made with incomplete information.</p>
            <p>We <i>need</i> to make choices, but choices will <i>definitely</i> trap us.</p>
            <p>How to reconcile this?</p>
            <p>By choosing our own trappings.</p>
            <p>The world is too complex to be managed without constraints. To become something, we have to give up everything else.</p>
            <p>And thankfully, we get to choose what to give up.</p>
            <p>If we make these tradeoffs voluntarily (rather than waiting for time to force our hand), we can use constraints to our advantage.</p>
            <p>Instead of tying us down, these decisions can narrow our focus, freeing us to explore the space that remains.</p>
            <p>Chances are, some choices won't pan out as well as we hope.</p>
            <p>But maybe, in the end, that doesn't <a href=./sincerity>matter</a>.</p>
