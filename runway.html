            <p>Leverage creates outsized returns.</p>
            <p>It can give us hundreds, or thousands, or millions of times more output for each unit of input.</p>
            <p>And as you'd imagine, this creates extreme inequality. Winners win big, and losers are rarely noticed.</p>
            <p>But there's more to it than that.</p>
            <p>Not only do bigger opportunities imply inequality, they also require more upfront investment. A lemonade stand can be opened in an hour, but the next big tech empire might take <i>decades</i> to reach its potential.</p>
            <p>This means long periods of time, burning through resources, with no concrete signs of success.</p>
            <p>And so, to succeed, we need long time horizons.</p>
            <p>But to have long time horizons, we first need to survive. Building goodwill is great, but we can't eat thank-you notes.</p>
            <p>A common solution is to work from the bottom up.</p>
            <p>This means progressing through smaller, less leveraged opportunities to create cash flow for larger ones.</p>
            <p>There are two benefits to this approach:</p>
            <p>1) We're less likely to starve</p>
            <p>2) We discover unknown unknowns in the process</p>
            <p>It might feel like this comes at the cost of speed. But maybe the extra lessons make us more efficient to compensate.</p>
            <p>And besides: if we have a long time horizon, it's irrelevant.</p>
            <p>But <a href="./commitment">where to start?</a></p>
