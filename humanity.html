                <p>Everything is changing.</p>
                <p>As the world speeds up, more and more people will become disoriented. And once we're disoriented, it's all too easy to become demoralised.</p>
                <p>Yet amidst all this confusion, some constants remain.</p>
                <p>Our material surroundings will differ. But for those willing to look deep enough, our moral principles will never change.</p>
                <p>What does this mean?</p>
                <p>It means that when we place our own value structures above those of whatever material game we happen to be playing, <i>everything we do becomes fundamentally valuable.</i></p>
                <p>As long as we adapt our moral structures based on truth-seeking dialogue, everything compounds unto itself. Always.</p>
                <p>Status-seekers will tell us to abandon responsibility in hopes of winning short-term supporters. Rent-seekers will tell us to sacrifice our agency in hopes of boosting short-term revenue.</p>
                <p>But no external force, no matter how powerful, can take our principles away.</p>
                <p>For as long as we're alive, we shoulder this burden voluntarily.</p>
                <p>Maybe that's what it is to be <a href="./all2gether">human</a>.</p>
