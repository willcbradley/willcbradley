        <p>Many things work <i>in theory</i>.</p>
        <p>There's a time for thinking in generalities, and a time for testing our projects against the world. They are not the same time.</p>
        <p>As a rule: I aim to only do things that are hyper-general (like these principles) or hyper-specific.</p>
        <p>It should be clearly obvious whether I've succeeded or failed, based on market feedback, the laws of physics, or both.</p>
        <p>Of course, this can be quite painful.</p>
        <p>When we work hard on something, it hurts to see it die.</p>
        <p>But consider the alternative: with no criteria for failure, it's impossible to know if we've succeeded.</p>
        <p>This can be overdone. "No risk, no reward" can be used as a socially acceptable excuse for bad decisions.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, without failing specifically, it's hard to learn specifically. And without that, we're flying blind.</p>
