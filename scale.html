            <p>We've come a long way.</p>
            <p>These principles are designed to ground me (as an individual) in the world, independent of the massive uncertainty on the horizon.</p>
            <p>But nobody is truly independent.</p>
            <p>To remain sane, certain tradeoffs are necessary.</p>
            <p>We can't form relationships without sacrificing some individuality, or work in teams without sacrificing some control, or join society without sacrificing some autonomy. These structures are restrictive, as a function of their scale.</p>
            <p>You could argue that this is weakness. But then you'd have to argue that all forms of human interaction (including cultures, communities, and families) are nothing but cowardice, which seems like a bad idea.</p>
            <p>So what's the alternative?</p>
            <p>How about this: we produce more than we consume.</p>
            <p>We pay prosperity forward, rather than shrinking ourselves back to the stone age.</p>
            <p>We dare to imagine that tomorrow could be better than today.</p>
            <p>With the right principles, we can learn to be less dependent on superficial structures.</p>
            <p>But at a certain point, dependence becomes necessary.</p>
            <p>If civilisation goes down, we'll go down with it. And the threats will only grow larger with time.</p>
            <p>More than ever, we'll need people who can withstand uncertainty, think beyond themselves, and work earnestly to move humanity forward. People who are competent enough to produce surplus, and wise enough to reinvest that surplus for the long term.</p>
            <p>Why not us?</p>
