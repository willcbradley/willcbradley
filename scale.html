            <p>We've come a long way.</p>
            <p>These principles are designed to orient me (as an individual) in the world, independent of the massive uncertainty of the future.</p>
            <p>But nobody is truly independent.</p>
            <p>To remain sane, certain tradeoffs are necessary.</p>
            <p>We can't form relationships without sacrificing some individuality, or work in teams without sacrificing some control, or join society without sacrificing some autonomy. These things are restrictive, by definition.</p>
            <p>You could argue that this is weakness. But then you'd have to argue that all forms of human interaction (including cultures, communities, and families) are nothing but cowardice, which seems like a bad idea.</p>
            <p>So what's the alternative? How to justify this reliance?</p>
            <p>By producing more than we consume.</p>
            <p>By being a net benefit to the world, rather than shrinking ourselves back to the stone age.</p>
            <p>By daring to imagine that tomorrow could be better than today.</p>
            <p>With the right principles, we can learn to be less reliant on superficial structures. But at a certain point, dependence becomes necessary.</p>
            <p>If civilisation goes down, we'll go down with it. And the threats will only grow larger with time.</p>
            <p>More than ever, we'll need people who can withstand uncertainty, think beyond themselves, and move humanity forward. People who produce their own surplus, and reinvest that surplus over the longest time horizon imaginable.</p>
            <p>People who are smart enough to understand the risks that lie ahead, skilled enough to navigate them, and wise enough to do so at scale.</p>
            <p>Why not us?</p>
