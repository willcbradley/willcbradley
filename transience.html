        <p>Let's back up for a second.</p>
        <p>We now know we need to follow our curiosity to unique insights, and build specific projects to test those ideas against reality.</p>
        <p>But curiosity can be erratic.</p>
        <p>And if you're anything like me, this is concerning.</p>
        <p>After all, if I'm supposed follow my curiosity, how can I be sure it'll lead me somewhere good?</p>
        <p>There are two important answers to this question:</p>
        <p>First, as we just learned, we want to be the best in the world at what we do. And unless we have <i>everything</i> (including curiosity) working in our favour, this won't happen.</p>
        <p>Second, random projects can yield predictable rewards if we're willing to <a href="./abstraction">look deep enough</a>.</p>
