            <p>Reality is rough.</p>
            <p>We can’t change the laws of physics or human nature, no matter how hard we try.</p>
            <p>Which explains why most jobs remain distanced from the real world. For every paramedic or door-to-door salesman, there are many other people sitting in meetings, far removed from these feedback mechanisms.</p>
            <p>Why emphasise this difference?</p>
            <p>Because it illustrates the link between risk and autonomy.</p>
            <p>A junior doctor who networks and memorises his way into cardiology training is at the mercy of superiors, whereas a world-class engineer is valuable <i>independent</i> of any employer.</p>
            <p>To create real value, we need to take real risk.</p>
            <p>But risk implies downside. And as technology improves connectivity and scalability, it’s not hard to imagine the emergence of brutal, winner-takes-all markets.</p>
            <p>Which is why it can pay to hedge our bets.</p>
            <p>Nobody knows exactly how AI and robotics will change the world.</p>
            <p>Maybe it renders fake, risk-free status games obsolete, or maybe the status game is all that’s left.</p>
            <p>But by positioning ourselves to operate in either environment, we eliminate the need to predict the future.</p>
            <p>Usually, hedging implies inefficiency.</p>
            <p>It demands a greater investment of time and effort than other paths, often into highly perishable skills.</p>
            <p>But fundamental skills are fundamental for a reason. With enough work, there's nothing stopping us from developing them, no matter the inefficiency.</p>
