        <div class="body">
            <p>The market is brutal.</p>
            <p>Relying on pure fundamentals to survive is a huge risk, especially as technology advances.</p>
            <p>This is where hedging comes in.</p>
            <p>By playing games that are (somewhat) insulated from free markets and nature, we avoid superlinear redundancy.</p>
            <p>In this context, 'nature' becomes the rules of the game, and 'markets' become the human element.</p>
            <p>The upside is a greater probability of survival. The downside is that the game might disappear — the core skills are retained, but the context becomes irrelevant, stopping our knowledge from compounding as smoothly.</p>
            <p>Then, eventually, the incremental returns of the hedge are outweighed by the option of playing in the big leagues.</p>
            <p>This can happen for two reasons:</p>
            <p class="zero-bottom">1. The (absolute/practical) rewards of the hedge decrease</p>
            <p>2. We build enough skills and runway to take on bigger challenges</p>
            <p>In this way, we <i>earn the right</i> to deal in fundamentals.</p>
            <p>Every step forward, no matter how mundane, gets us closer to true autonomy.</p>
            <p>The person who commits to, masters, and transcends the game in front of them is inevitable, no matter where they start out.</p>
            <p>As long as opportunities exist, nobody can stop us from working towards them.</p>
