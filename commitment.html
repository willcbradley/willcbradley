            <p>Uncertainty is scary.</p>
            <p>The world is changing faster than ever, and only seems to be speeding up.</p>
            <p>There are so many opportunities, and so little time.</p>
            <p>Which begs the question: if we don't know which way is the right way forward, why move anywhere at all?</p>
            <p>Why not wait until we're <i>sure</i> which direction is correct? Wouldn't that ensure none of our effort is wasted?</p>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>As tempting as this might sound, it's a trap.</p>
            <p>Nobody can predict the future. We can make our best bad guess, but anything more is speculation.</p>
            <p>If we refuse to commit to a single path forward, we're <i>committing to never move anywhere, with 100% certainty.</i></p>
            <p>And if we never move anywhere, we'll never reap the rewards of compounding.</p>
            <p>The alternative?</p>
            <p>Commit. Collapse the infinite futures into a single (real) present, even if this means cutting off other options.</p>
            <p>Move down the decision tree of time, rather than sitting indefinitely at the root node.</p>
            <p>Adapt based on real-world feedback, instead of trying to predict the unpredictable.</p>
            <p>And at each fork in the road, stay close to the <a href="./fundamentals">fundamentals</a>.</p>
