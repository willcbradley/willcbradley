        <p>Things are complicated.</p>
        <p>It's tempting to try and re-derive the world from fundamentals, but this is a mistake.</p>
        <p>Politics cannot be re-derived from speaking to individual people. Biology cannot be re-derived from studying individual atoms. In complex systems, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
        <p>And it's these extra features, these emergent properties, that create a never-ending supply of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>The fundamentals are invaluable, but they are not everything.</p>
        <p>How to account for this?</p>
        <p>By incurring inefficiency. By leaving the world of perfect ideas, and entering reality. By tolerating the memorisation, and the arbitrary rules, and the imperfection that comes with complexity.</p>
        <p>There is no substitute for a foundational understanding of the world, and it should not be skimped on. But to build something on top of this foundation, we need to get our hands dirty.</p>
        <p>And once we do, the fun begins.</p>
