        <p>Not all structures are equal.</p>
        <p>As the world becomes more leveraged, the opportunity vehicle we're in could be the difference between ultrawealth and poverty.</p>
        <p>From a material perspective, the choice matters immensely. Morally, all that matter is that we choose.</p>
        <p>The trick, as far as I can tell, is to have the humility to place the moral above the material.</p>
        <p>We could argue about the value of different structures, but we can't deny the necessity of choosing <i>something</i>.</p>
        <p>But choosing, alone, is <a href="./sacrifice">not enough</a>.</p>
