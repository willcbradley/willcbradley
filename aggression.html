            <p>You might object: wouldn't it be better to have no aggression in the first place?</p>
            <p>Wouldn't the world be more peaceful if we all looked after each other, and avoided conflict, and only took what we needed? Wouldn't we be better served if we worked together, dividing the world's spoils evenly rather than competing?</p>
