            <p>Society needs competence.</p>
            <p>Without genuinely skilled people in genuinely useful jobs, everything falls apart.</p>
            <p>But there's more to it than that.</p>
            <p>We can't improve our existing structures until we've been through a requisite disciplinary process.</p>
            <p>Until we're competent players, we haven't earned the right to criticise the game.</p>
