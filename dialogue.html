        <div class="body">
            <p>We all make mistakes.</p>
            <p>Our perspectives are flawed, our experience limited, and our judgement fallible.</p>
            <p>But mistakes can be redemptive.</p>
            <p>And through free, open, forthright dicussions, we can sharpen our collective understanding of the world.</p>
            <p>True dialogue integrates us, at all levels of abstraction.</p>
            <p>It lets us channel aggression into competence, ambition into leadership, and competition into prosperity.</p>
            <p>It tells us which of our ideas need to die, so that we might survive.</p>
            <p>And it re-orients our civilisation towards a better future (and away from worse ones).</p>
            <p>Think about it:</p>
            <p>Societal structures, by design, are relatively slow to change.</p>
            <p>As technological progress gets faster, this sluggishness will only become more obvious.</p>
            <p>Without the ability to hash out our priorities in good faith, we will probably go extinct.</p>
            <p>But assume we succeed.</p>
            <p>Assume we figure out what is more important, and what is less.</p>
            <p>Even then, choosing is <a href="./sacrifice">not enough</a>.</p>
