        <p>Nobody is perfect.</p>
        <p>No matter how hard we try, we'll never know everything.</p>
        <p>Which creates an interesting problem: how to distinguish morality from weakness, if our understanding of "morality" is flawed?</p>
        <p>Leaning on morals can be a sign of strength, but (perhaps more often) it can also be a sign of cowardice.</p>
        <p>Without capacity for danger, there's no virtue in being passive. And the more insulated we are from true threats, the easier it is to confuse the admirable and the pitiful.</p>
