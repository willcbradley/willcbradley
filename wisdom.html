        <div class="body">
            <p>There are infinite problems.</p>
            <p>No matter how much we understand about the world, our knowledge will remain incomplete.</p>
            <p>There are always exceptions to the rule. Always holes in the theory. Always new discoveries on the horizon that will flip our current assumptions upside down.</p>
            <p>Why is this important?</p>
            <p>Because it means that reality is an open-ended problem.</p>
            <p>It cannot be solved ahead of time. There's no optimal strategy to be found. To do anything, we need to risk everything.</p>
            <p>But it also seems like there's a deeper certainty.</p>
            <p>A set of emergent properties that arise from our continual expansion of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Fundamentals that lie outside the realm of understanding, but that are necessary for such understanding to survive.</p>
            <p>Constraints that reduce the world to solvable problems, so that we can move forward.</p>
            <p>Ideas that demand the subjugation of <i>everything else</i>, but in return, promise something infinitely better.</p>
            <p>Such principles could invalidate everything we've just discussed.</p>
            <p>Maybe that's why they're <a href="./alltogether">necessary</a>.</p>
