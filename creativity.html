        <p>Technology creates leverage.</p>
        <p>With AI and robots, every problem becomes a software problem.</p>
        <p>And since software has zero marginal cost of replication, it can be distributed to everyone in the world. Said differently: every competition becomes a global competition.</p>
        <p>Before robots, two people can own lawn-mowing companies in different countries. After robots, the company whose robots are best at lawn mowing will devour the whole market.</p>
        <p>The upshot?</p>
        <p>To provide future-proof value, we need to create something entirely new (or a significantly better version of something that already exists).</p>
        <p>And to do this, we need to be <i>the best in the world</i> at something.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, "something" can be narrow.</p>
        <p>If we pursue our own curiosity far enough (instead of the latest trends), we stumble onto ideas that nobody else would've thought to look for.</p>
        <p>Then, by applying this insight to solve people's problems, we can create wealth from scratch.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this raises <a href="./transience">another problem</a>.</p>
