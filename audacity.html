        <div class="body">
            <p>Pessimism is always beckoning.</p>
            <p>It shelters us from disappointment, makes us look wise, and frees us from responsibility.</p>
            <p>It shuns forward-striving achievement, leaving us to shelter our egos in zero-sum, pseudo-egalitarian status games.</p>
            <p>It makes today easier, at the expense of tomorrow.</p>
            <p>But there's an alternative.</p>
            <p>We can be audacious. We can set our sights so high that it justifies the effort.</p>
            <p>We can make the world better, according to our value systems.</p>
            <p>And when corruption inevitably grows in the corpses of our great institutions, we can redeem them through courageous, precise, well-articulated dialogue.</p>
            <p>There is no limit. No finite prize to be divided up. We can create (and have created) wealth from nothing, enriching everybody in the process.</p>
            <p>The only constraint is ourselves.</p>
            <p>Think about it:</p>
            <p>Either there's something unique about humanity, or we'll eventually be replaced by our own inventions.</p>
            <p>If we refuse to move forward, we will definitely perish. But if we risk moving forward, we might just survive.</p>
            <p>Maybe, at a fundamental level, existence is an act of optimism.</p>
            <p>A choice to accept a value system, however flawed, and strive towards something better.</p>
            <p>A decision to push humanity further, and to refine our ideals asymptotically towards perfection. No matter what.</p>
            <p>This is a mortal game. We will not make it out alive.</p>
            <p>But what if we worked towards a future so inspiring that it was worth sacrificing for, in spite of this?</p>
            <p>Maybe we'll fail. Maybe extinction is inevitable.</p>
            <p>But we have to <a href="./all2gether">try</a>.</p>
