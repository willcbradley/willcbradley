            <p>Pessimism is always beckoning.</p>
            <p>It shelters us from disappointment, and makes us look wise, and frees us from responsibility.</p>
            <p>It shuns forward-striving achievement, leaving us to shelter our egos in zero-sum, pseudo-egalitarian status games.</p>
            <p>It makes today easier, at the expense of tomorrow.</p>
            <p>But there's an alternative.</p>
            <p>We can be audacious. We can set our sights so high that it justifies our suffering.</p>
            <p>We can make the world better, according to our value systems.</p>
            <p>And when corruption inevitably grows in the corpses of our great institutions, we can redeem them through courageous, precise, well-articulated dialogue.</p>
            <p>There is no limit. No fixed prize that need to be divided up. We can create (and have created) something from nothing, enriching everybody in the process.</p>
            <p>Humanity is constrained by itself. Not by the universe.</p>
            <p>Maybe we'll fail. Maybe extinction is inevitable.</p>
            <p>But we have to <a href="./all2gether">try</a>.</p>
