        <p>Things are speeding up.</p>
        <p>Today's world is nothing like our grandparents', and will be nothing like our grandchildren's.</p>
        <p>In early medical school, this puzzled me. It was hard to distinguish between the zero-sum career contest and the fundamental essence of medicine.</p>
        <p>What was I supposed to stand for? Would new technology wipe out my job? What did it mean to be a good doctor?</p>
        <p>The culprit, as far as I can see, was pessimism.</p>
        <p>The assumption that one person's success is another's failure.</p>
        <p>The insistence that ambition is fundamentally oppressive.</p>
        <p>The claim that there are <i>too many people on the planet.</i></p>
        <p>These ideas were presented as truths, but they demoralised me. So I went back to basics, in search of a path forward.</p>
        <p>From first principles, I tried to figure out <a href="./principles" target="_blank">what</a> to do, and <a href="./principles#m" target="_blank">why</a>.</p>
        <p>Now, it's time to put these principles into practice.</p>
        <p>I expect it'll take a few decades before I'm competent enough to have much of an impact. Even then, I'll probably fail.</p>
        <p>But the alternative is to give up.</p>
        <p>To let pessimism win, and squander the world that's been left to us by our ancestors.</p>
        <p>And that's no choice at all.</p>
        <p> - Will</p>
