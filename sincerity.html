            <p>Morality implies inefficiency.</p>
            <p>Some amount of arbitrary rules are required to hold civilisation together.</p>
            <p>But this balance is delicate, and our moral codes are necessarily flawed. So inevitably, we create status games that (by definition) are disconnected from morality and reality.</p>
            <p>At their best, these status games create functional, widespread networks of trust. But at their worst, they become corrupt, metastatic, zero-sum breeding grounds for resentment and (eventually) violence.</p>
            <p>To make matters worse, we're wired to care deeply about status.</p>
            <p>How to get around all this?</p>
            <p>Prioritisation.</p>
            <p>Just like we place the moral above the material, we can place the material above status games.</p>
            <p>Rather than rejecting the rules outright, we can accept them on our own terms.</p>
            <p>This lets us extract the lessons from these games without overweighting them.</p>
            <p>And in so doing, we can earn our <a href="./dialogue">seat at the table</a>.</p>
