            <p>We've come a long way.</p>
            <p>These principles are designed to orient me in the world, independent of the massive uncertainty of the future.</p>
            <p>But nobody is truly independent.</p>
            <p>To remain sane, certain tradeoffs are needed.</p>
            <p>We can't form relationships without sacrificing some individuality, or work in teams without sacrificing some control, or join society without sacrificing some autonomy. These things are restrictive, as a function of scale.</p>
            <p>You could argue that this is weakness. But then you'd have to argue that all forms of human interaction (including cultures, communities, and families) are nothing but cowardice, which seems like a bad idea.</p>
            <p>So which tradeoffs to make? How much freedom to give up?</p>
            <p>Competence determines the depth of problems we can work on, and desire for status determines the breadth of extra social responsibility we seek in the process.</p>
            <p>But these are both somewhat changeable — is there an optimal path forward?</p>
            <p>No. I don't think so.</p>
            <p>We could think about this problem forever, and we'd never reach an answer.</p>
            <p>It seems like there's an irreducible element of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>We don't get to skip to the end of the story. We have to write the plot in real time.</p>
            <p>What to do, then?</p>
            <p>Tell the best story imaginable.</p>
            <p>Move towards a better future, in spite of the all-too-real risks.</p>
            <p>Build something incredible, so that future generations might pick up where we left off.</p>
            <p>Think of all the people who came before us. Think of the unbelievable gifts they left behind. These people laid down their lives, despite the uncertainty, for our sake. Was their sacrifice in vain? Will we waste what they've given us?</p>
            <p>Right now, as you're reading this, there's a kid sitting in his bedroom somewhere. He has the potential to change the world. To cure new diseases, or terraform new planets, or discover new fundamental laws that shift our understanding of reality.</p>
            <p>It's our responsibility to give him hope.</p>
            <p>To be more convincing than the cynical, nihilistic, zero-sum slogans he's tempted with.</p>
            <p>To do so with action, and not just talk.</p>
            <p>We will leave no room for doubt.</p>
