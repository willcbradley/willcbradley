            <p>Only truth survives.</p>
            <p>Technological acceleration is likely to create extreme inequality.</p>
            <p>And in response to this inequality, we have a history of trying to <i>force</i> everyone to be equal (at least, superficially).</p>
            <p>This often results in rejection of the inequality required for prioritization, creating widespread hopelessness.</p>
            <p>How to avoid this fate, given the massive changes on the horizon?</p>
            <p>By telling a better story.</p>
            <p>Nobody can stop us from imagining a better future.</p>
            <p>Nobody can stop us from making fundamental, undeniable progress toward this ideal.</p>
            <p>Nobody can stop us from building a world where our grandchildren can dare to be optimistic.</p>
            <p>We can take our place as apprentices of great thinkers.</p>
            <p>We can make the sacrifices necessary to become competent, honourable, and disciplined.</p>
            <p>And then, slowly, humbly, carefully, we can renew the structures we’ve inherited.</p>
            <p>Superficial values won't withstand the difficulties that lie ahead.</p>
            <p>Corruption, resentment, and short-sightedness all threaten to take us out of the game.</p>
            <p>But maybe, if we’re willing to look deep enough, we can build something better.</p>
            <p>Only one way to find out.</p>
