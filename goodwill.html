            <p>Humans are wired for reciprocity.</p>
            <p>We feel uncomfortable if we receive too many favours without giving something in return.</p>
            <p>And in a similar way, the more problems we solve for the market, the more it will want to reward us.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, think back to our discussion of leverage.</p>
            <p>Increasingly, the mechanisms of leverage are commoditised. Anybody can post a video, or write a program, or outsource repetitive work to a computer.</p>
            <p>Only the core insight, the <i>value</i>, remains unique.</p>
            <p>The upshot?</p>
            <p>As leverage gets cheaper, the incremental cost of replicating this value approaches zero. We can build a solution once, and give it to billions of people with no extra effort.</p>
            <p>Then, if these cost savings are transferred to the end user, it can generate ridiculous amounts of goodwill.</p>
            <p>By all means, it's possible to cash in early. This is what people do when they sell online courses, or expensive software, or any other highly leveraged asset.</p>
            <p>But when money is left on the table, it tends to multiply.</p>
            <p>And if we wait, and make our money on the backend (rather than upfront), the market will often reward us handsomely.</p>
            <p>There's just one problem: this requires a long time horizon.</p>
            <p>How are we supposed to survive in the meantime?</p>
            <p>The answer lies in having <a href="./runway">runway</a>.</p>
