        <p class="idea-body">Things break easily.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">There are infinite ways for them to go wrong, and only a few where they work out.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">For example, I’m typing this with my hands. They’re an incredible arrangement of bones, ligaments, tendons, blood vessels, nerves, and other stuff.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">In almost every other arrangement of these structures, I’d have a bleeding blob of meat and bone attached to my wrists. And yet, somehow, you’re reading this.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The same is true in markets.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Imagine I start a company that tries to solve fusion energy.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Chances are, it’s not going to work. There are many ways to build a broken nuclear fusion reactor, and only a few (if any) that function as required.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The odds of success are unimaginably slim. But if I succeeded, the rewards would be unimaginably huge.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">What can we conclude from this?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">That in order to create something new, you have to stomach an extremely small chance of success (with a comparatively larger potential payoff). The bigger the creation, the worse the odds, but the higher the rewards.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Taleb addressed this better than I ever could in Antifragile (see <a href="./books#philosophy-ethics">books</a>), but I’ve got a more practical question in mind:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">How do you structure your life in light of this fact?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">One solution is to take on maximal risk.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Throw caution to the wind, and specialise in producing new, novel ideas.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Another answer is to never create anything new. Get your accounting degree, and drive your company car to the same building for the next 50 years.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Of course, the answer is that both are necessary.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And smart people have already figured out a reasonable solution (again, Taleb’s Antifragile): the barbell.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">If you have a barbelled risk profile, you take ultra-safe bets to avoid intolerable losses, and throw the rest into high-risk, high reward bets.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This is the accountant who works 50 hours a week, but spends nights and weekends writing his screenplay.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But I’ve got another question:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">What happens when technology uproots our “low-risk” plays?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">What should the accountant do when he’s replaced by the newest piece of AI (and the keys to his company car are revoked)?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">How do we hedge our bets when the world is mass-producing hedge trimmers?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">I think it comes down to two main ideas:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">First, anchor yourself with truly fundamentals skills – these are first-principles thinking, and the ability to influence other people. No matter what gets automated, these remain valuable.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Second, <a href="./decommodify">build a unique brand</a>. The more you’re differentiated, the harder you are to automate, and the higher your perceived value.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Luckily, these both compound over time.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The more skills you have, and the stronger your brand, the lower your risk profile.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The lower your risk profile, the bigger the swings you can take while maintaining a barbelled approach.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And the bigger your swings, the higher your odds of building something incredible.</p>
