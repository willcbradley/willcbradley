        <p>Things are changing quickly.</p>
        <p>In a world of ever-growing uncertainty, it often seems like flexibility is king.</p>
        <p>It's less about what we're doing right now, and more about what we <i>could</i> be doing in the future. Less about accomplishments, and more about potential.</p>
        <p>I held this belief for a long time. But I was missing something important: potential is a function of time.</p>
        <p>The longer we wait to cash in on it, the less it's worth.</p>
        <p>The alternative to waiting?</p>
        <p>Intentionally sacrificing options. Killing off potential futures, so that one might survive.</p>
        <p>This is painful, sure. But time doesn't stand still - if we don't make these trade-offs voluntarily, they will be taken from us forcefully.</p>
        <p>And yet, humanity is chipping away at the traditions and institutions that once told us what to sacrifice towards, and why.</p>
        <p>Mix in hyper-optimised algorithms that feed our childish delusions of superiority, and it's no wonder that people would rather be failed influencers than successful factory workers.</p>
        <p>The incentives are clear. And it's not pretty.</p>
        <p>We've built a world so comfortable that the dull ache of unmet potential is drowned out by the hope of far-fetched, half-arsed goals (at least, in the short term).</p>
        <p>It's easier to remain in Hypothetical Land, philosophising about potential futures. At least then, we don't have to risk confronting the boring, risky, repetitive drudgery required to bring one of these visions to life.</p>
        <p>(Why do you think I spent years deriving my own moral and material principles from scratch?)</p>
        <p>And so we sit, pulling at the slot machine of modernity, even as the casino steadily burns to the ground. We feel the heat, but we aren't brave enough to look at the fire.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the flames will reach us. And it'll be too late to run.</p>
        <p>Unless, of course, we take the plunge on our own terms.</p>
        <p>What if there's no wrong choice? What if the worst-case real outcome is better than the best-case fictional one? What if applying ourselves to <i>anything</i> will teach us the lessons we didn't know we needed to learn?</p>
        <p>Without allowing ourselves to be trapped, we will never be free.</p>
