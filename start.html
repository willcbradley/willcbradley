        <p>Our economies are incredible.</p>
        <p>They produce some of the most highly trained, specialised people on the planet.</p>
        <p>But specialisation carries risk.</p>
        <p>And as technology moves faster and faster, there’s no telling what tasks (or jobs) will be automated.</p>
        <p>I spent years trying to solve this problem, and after a lot of painful mistakes, arrived at these principles. They hold true for as long as machines haven't <i>completely</i> replaced humans.</p>
        <p>I've found them very useful. Maybe you will too.</p>
        <p>Any questions, <a href="https://willcbradley.com/contact" target="_blank">let me know.</a></p>
        <p>Otherwise, let’s start by discussing a common misconception:</p>
