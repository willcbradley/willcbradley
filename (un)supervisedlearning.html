        <p class="idea-body">Imagine you want to diagnose a skin lesion.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">You look at it under a dermatoscope, assess it based on the criteria and cases you’ve seen before, and make a diagnosis.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">If you had no point of comparison, this would be impossible.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But, by referring back to fundamental criteria, you can reach the right conclusion.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This is the essence of supervised learning.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We show a model lots of inputs (e.g. a skin lesion), and show it the right output (e.g. “this is benign”), and let it develop pattern recognition.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">With enough experience, we can remove the output, and let the model infer the right answer based on past experience.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Supervised learning can use classification when there are a finite number of outputs (e.g. is this lesion benign or malignant?), or regression when there are infinite outputs (e.g. what’s this patient’s five-year cardiovascular risk?).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">With more data, the model gets better and better at figuring out the right answer.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">On the other hand, in unsupervised learning, we provide no “right answers”.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Instead, we feed a model a bunch of data, and ask it to find its own pattern.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Often, computer find patterns that we’d never notice.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">For instance, we now have models that can detect BMI, diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, sex, kidney, liver, and gall bladder disease, and risk of heart attack, stroke, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s — <i>all from a retinal image.</i></p>
        <p class="idea-body">Incredible, right?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Let’s explore a simple kind of supervised learning <a href="./regression">in more detail.</a></p>
