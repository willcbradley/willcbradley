            <p>Automation loves specificity.</p>
            <p>If a task is easy to explain, it's easy to teach to a robot.</p>
            <p>So, if we want to avoid competing with superhuman machines, we need to run in the opposite direction.</p>
            <p>The more abstract the value being provided, the more resistant it is to replacement (and therefore the less likely we are to be taken out of the game).</p>
            <p>And as a general rule, technology automates the mundane, bringing us incrementally closer the heart of any given problem.</p>
            <p>The trick is to project this process into the future.</p>
            <p>Already, robots are learning to suture. But it seems less likely that they'll be able to comfort a nervous pre-op patient.</p>
            <p>AI models are becoming more reliable, but they don't seem to have <a href="./reputation" target="_blank">reputations</a> in the same way you and I do.</p>
            <p>For as long as there are <i>any</i> differences between us an machines, we can double down on them to carve out opportunities. </p>
            <p>And by banking on this, we give ourselves a shot at reaping the <a href="./compounding">real rewards</a>.</p>
