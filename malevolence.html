            <p>Once, we were naive.</p>
            <p>Failing to see the brutality of the world, we remained ignorant of our own circumstances.</p>
            <p>But things changed.</p>
            <p>Individually and collectively, our naivete was shattered.</p>
            <p>We learned that the world was complex, that things were uncertain, that we could be hurt.</p>
            <p>And in the process, we learned how to hurt others.</p>
            <p>Nobody likes to think about malevolence, but it is undeniable.</p>
            <p>We're all capable of terrible atrorcities (especially those who think they aren't).</p>
