        <p>Healthcare is highly regulated.</p>
        <p>It's not hard to see why: high-stakes decisions demand high-strength guardrails. When my life's on the line, I don't want my doctor winging it.</p>
        <p>But there are side effects.</p>
        <p>Regulation insulates us from reality, replacing meritocracy with status games. And often, status games can become warped, bloated, and zero-sum.</p>
        <p>The upshot?</p>
        <p>Succeeding as a doctor requires a different skillset to succeeding in the free market. And as technological change speeds up, this difference will only grow.</p>
        <p>This leaves today's doctors in a rough spot.</p>
        <p>On one hand, they could go all-in on the medical game. This makes them entirely reliant on regulators, but at least they'll have a shot at getting onto specialty training.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, they could neglect the game, choosing instead to learn skills that let them survive in the market. But if that's the goal, why bother with a medical degree?</p>
        <p>It's a catch-22.</p>
        <p>Those who play by the rules risk tech-driven redundancy, and those who reject them risk being chewed up and spat out by winner-take-all markets.</p>
        <p>We're being pulled in two opposing directions at once. Each step forward is also a step backward.</p>
        <p>Unless we're missing something.</p>
        <p>If medicine is nothing but a series of exams, hospitals, and training programs, then we remain trapped. If it's purely a way of paying the bills, the same is true.</p>
        <p>But what if there's something more durable?</p>
        <p>Something that's universally present, no matter the situation? Something we can always count on, for as long as humans exist?</p>
        <p>I spent a long time looking, and the only constant I could find is suffering. This might sound pessimistic, but I'm not so sure.</p>
        <p>After all, what if medicine was the open-eyed acceptance of inevitable suffering, and the decision to work against it anyway?</p>
        <p>What if we held this ideal above all else, no matter what?</p>
        <p>Maybe this involves certain career milestones. Maybe it involves operating in the free market. But these become secondary, interchangeable processes in service of the main goal.</p>
        <p>If we get a nice job title in the process, that's great. If we can afford a few extra Porsches, all the better.</p>
        <p>But the faster the world moves, the more fundamental our motivations need to be.</p>
        <p>And unless we figure this out in time, I doubt tomorrow's doctors will be able to save themselves, let alone their patients.</p>
        <p>Seems worth a try.</p>
