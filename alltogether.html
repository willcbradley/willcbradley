        <p>Aim to build (and own) things that people want, instead of scrounging around for money or status.</p>
        <p>Radically accept human nature, then learn to create unique value for society by combining foundational knowledge (learned through exposure to markets and physics) with specialised, cutting-edge knowledge (learned through following curiosity).</p>
        <p>Use leverage to your advantage, and give away that advantage to bank goodwill.</p>
        <p>Move through opportunity vehicles from simple to advanced, building runway (and requisite skills) in the process.</p>
        <p>Abstract out the durable compounding mechanisms that underpin your work, and plow as many resources as you can towards them.</p>
        <p>Commit to the best plan you have, so you can fail (and succeed) <i>specifically</i>. Allow each step forward to illuminate the next.</p>
        <p>In the process, provide more value than you consume, and take the value of reputation seriously.</p>
        <p>Ignore the "lucky breaks" of others, extend your time horizon far into the future, and hedge your bets to ensure you aren't taken out of the game.</p>
        <p>Understand the price of your hedge, and pay it gladly. If it's too expensive, pick a different one.</p>
        <p>And detach from outcomes. External rewards aren't guaranteed, but in hindsight, they're beside the point.</p>
