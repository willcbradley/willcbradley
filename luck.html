        <p>Next time you meet a rich person, ask them how they made their money.</p>
        <p>Chances are, they’ll tell you how hard they worked.</p>
        <p>And yet, I guarantee you there are people who’ve worked a lot harder, and received a lot less in return.</p>
        <p>Much of this comes down to leverage and skill, but unfortunately, some of it also comes down to luck.</p>
        <p>Bear in mind: being "lucky" isn't everything it's cut out to be.</p>
        <p>After all, the person who gets an early lucky break misses out on painful (but valuable) lessons. If their luck ever dries up, they won't have the skills to make everything back.</p>
        <p>Which begs the question: how can we be deterministic (especially given how fast the world is changing)?</p>
        <p>There’s a solution, but <a href="./patience">it's not pretty</a>.</p>
