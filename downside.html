        <p>If we can’t survive without our hedges, they aren’t hedges.</p>
        <p>Stability defangs people. And without fangs, it’s very difficult to survive in the wild.</p>
        <p>This typically happens in one of two ways:</p>
        <p>First, you become increasingly dependent on stability (attachment to job titles, lifestyle inflation etc).</p>
        <p>Second, other people become increasingly dependent on you (marriage, children etc).</p>
        <p>You can imagine how this compounds.</p>
        <p>When we have more downside, we’re less able to tolerate losses.</p>
        <p>This makes us less likely to expose ourselves to the <a target="_blank" href="./truth">real</a> world, and thus less able to survive without support from external structures (like employers).</p>
        <p>As the future becomes more uncertain, this dependence becomes riskier.</p>
        <p>So where's the <a href="./price">sweet spot?</a></p>
