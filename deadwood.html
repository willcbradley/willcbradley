        <p class="idea-body">Intelligence can be dangerous.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">For millennia, our best and brightest have discovered new ways of reducing suffering and advancing technology.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But, as we’ve also known for millennia, suffering is inevitable.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And we can’t stop the passage of time.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The upshot? Regardless of how boundless the world becomes, each of us needs to accept arbitrary constraints in order to mature.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">No matter how fast the tree of technology branches outward, we need to look inward, and allow the deadwood to burn off our own minds.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This admission might be what separates genius from hubris. And the penalty for neglecting it has never been higher.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But that doesn’t solve the problem – what constraints should we adopt?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">After all, the world is changing rapidly, and it’s going to speed up. What are the safe bets?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">It’s a complex problem, and I’ve been trying to figure it out for years.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Here’s the solution I’ve come up with thus far:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">1) <a href="./decommodify">Decommodify</a></p>
        <p class="idea-body">2) Learn <a href="./durability">fundamental</a> ideas/skills to <a href="./glory">clip your downside</a></p>
        <p class="idea-body">3) Orient yourself towards the <a href="./agencyandevil">best future you can imagine</a>, all things considered</p>
        <p class="idea-body">4) Then, pick day-to-day pursuits that align with that orientation</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This is no small feat.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But we’re staring down the barrel of the fastest rate of change in history, accelerated by a technological prisoner’s dilemma.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The way forward, as far as I can see, is to look backward.</p>
