            <p>Things take time.</p>
            <p>We have infinite potential, but finite lifespans.</p>
            <p>At any given moment, there's only so much to go around. Only so many people, with only so many resources, and only so much attention.</p>
            <p>This scarcity creates zero-sum competitions which, if left unchecked, will cause humanity to cannibalise itself.</p>
            <p>But is it ever right to play along?</p>
            <p>After all, human desire is infinite. We can never abolish scarcity, no matter how many problems we solve. And without some redistribution of resources, envy (justified or not) tends to destroy societies.</p>
            <p>How to get around this?</p>
            <p>By only playing zero-sum games <i>in service of positive-sum ones.</i></p>
            <p>On a long enough time horizon, there's almost nothing we can't do. But to reap long-term benefits, we first need to ensure short-term survival.</p>
            <p>And by acting accordingly, we get the <a href="./choice">best of both worlds</a>.</p>
