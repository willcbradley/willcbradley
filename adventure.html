            <p>There are no guarantees.</p>
            <p>Even if our principles are infallible, we certainly aren't.</p>
            <p>Every person, every country, and every empire in history has been crushed by the sands of time. And as technology accelerates this process, our fate looks surer than ever.</p>
            <p>Maybe consciousness is an emergent property of compute. Maybe technology tears our society apart at the seams. Maybe there's no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
            <p>What to rely on, then, in a world where nothing can be relied on?</p>
            <p>Adventure.</p>
            <p>Acting out the greatest possible story, across the longest span of time, benefiting the largest number of people we can manage.</p>
            <p>Hearing the earthquake coming, and building an empire anyway, so that somebody might repair it tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Chances are, things won't turn out how we expect.</p>
            <p>But maybe that was never the <a href="./alltogether">point</a>.</p>
