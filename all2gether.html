        <p>Life is extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>To withstand this difficulty, it helps to have something fundamental to rely on (rather than shallow, meaningless platitudes).</p>
        <p>This requires a notion of "better" and "worse", trading equality for survival.</p>
        <p>To instantiate the resultant hierarchies, we can build structures (to save us from the metabolically expensive act of solving everything from first principles).</p>
        <p>As the world becomes more leveraged, the choice of structure matters immensely, often based on unpredictable factors. But by placing the moral necessity of structure above material niceties of which structure, we can avoid decision paralysis.</p>
        <p>Maintaining these structures requries sacrifice, in line with their associated value structures.</p>
        <p>This only makes sense if we believe the future could possibly be better than the present.</p>
        <p>And as the pace of technological change accelerates, this becomes less an act of rationality, and more an act of courage.</p>
