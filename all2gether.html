        <p>Life is extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>To withstand this difficulty, it helps to have something fundamental to rely on (rather than shallow platitudes).</p>
        <p>This requires a notion of "better" and "worse", forcing us to trade equality for reality.</p>
        <p>To save us from the metabolically expensive act of solving everything from first principles, we can build structures to consolidate these value systems (both superficial and deep).</p>
        <p>As the world becomes more leveraged, our choice of superficial structure(s) has a huge effect on our material outcomes.</p>
        <p>But by placing the moral necessity of structure above material niceties of <i>any given</i> structure, we can avoid decision paralysis.</p>
        <p>Maintaining these structures requires sacrifice, in line with their associated value structures.</p>
        <p>This sacrifice only makes sense if we believe the future could possibly be better than the present.</p>
        <p>As the pace of technological change accelerates, this belief becomes less an act of rationality, and more an act of courage.</p>
        <p>And luckily, courage is always within our control.</p>
