        <p>Being naive is easy.</p>
        <p>Anybody can be brave when they don't understand the concept of danger. It's convenient, but not admirable.</p>
        <p>The same is true of cynicism. If everything is fundamentally corrupt, at least we can feel morally justified while doing nothing about it.</p>
        <p>But I propose a third option.</p>
        <p>I propose accepting the tragedy of existence, and striving upward anyway.</p>
        <p>Our backs are against the wall. If we stay in stasis, the world will overwhelm us. The only way out is through.</p>
        <p>Maybe we've chosen the wrong priorities.</p>
        <p>Maybe our attempts at making things better will fail miserably.</p>
        <p>But eventually, something has to work. And when it does, we can leave our learnings for <a href="./structure">future generations</a>.</p>
