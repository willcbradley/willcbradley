        <div class="body">
            <p>Medicine demands a combination of deep rationality and deep humanity. It’s not enough to know how to help patients – we also need to know <i>why</i>. Neither of these pillars can exist without the other. I believe both are under threat.</p>
            <p>Doctors occupy a unique position in society. We’ve collectively chosen to trust them with the most valuable asset we have: our health. But as repetitive tasks are automated, the role (and authority) of doctors can seem unnecessary. Which brings us to the core issue.</p>
            <p>Humanity is making incredible scientific progress. New inventions are giving us more agency than ever, including agency over our health. In comparison, human doctors begin to look like rent-seekers: why pay a physician or surgeon if an LLM or robot can do a better job? This is an important question, with an important answer.</p>
            <p>When a game is disconnected from reality, its rules become arbitrary. As doctors become more replaceable in routine tasks, their careers depend less on relevant skills and more on a regulatory status game. Instead of treating patients, they’re incentivised to focus on <i>earning the right</i> to treat patients. Rather than pushing medicine forward, they’re tasked with tearing each other down in “turf wars”, fighting to eek out a living in the zero-sum hierarchy of healthcare. Which begs the question: why not get rid of doctors altogether?</p>
            <p>Science is bounded by ethics. These ethical rules can’t be derived from mathematics – they’re principles that we collectively choose to believe (and renew) for the greater benefit of humanity. Which tells us something important: insofar as computers are inhuman, they can’t grasp the ethical principles that are fundamental to medicine. Said differently: computers can’t replace human doctors until they can completely replace humans (at which point there’s no need for healthcare at all). But we’re still left with the problem of the zero-sum regulation game. What’s the way out?</p>
            <p>People (including you and I) are naturally self-interested. We’re inclined to get while the getting’s good, even at the expense of others. There are exceptions, but broadly speaking, we can expect tomorrow's doctors to clamber over one another for a shot at a prestigious job, no matter the selection criteria. This has always been the case, but with increased leverage from technology, it seems that these jobs will only get scarcer. Unless we’re missing something.</p>
            <p>There is no stasis. When everybody’s focused on dividing up the existing rewards, things inevitably go to zero. Without the net creation of value, medicine will collapse. And without ethical guardrails, it risks spinning out of control.</p>
            <p>But what if we had people who can speak both languages? Full-stack doctors who can solve new problems in an old discipline? Doctors who can hold their own in clinical practice <i>and</i> in the free market? Doctors who create tangible wealth for society, rather than siphoning intangible money out of it?</p>
            <p>This is an extremely difficult problem. The stakes are high, and there’s a very good chance we’ll fail.</p>
            <p>But how could it be any other way?</p>
